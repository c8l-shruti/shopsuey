												<h1>ShopSuey Privacy Policy</h1>
												<p>Our mission at Shopping Made Mobile Inc. is to create a more enjoyable and rewarding shopping experience for you.  To make this possible, we need to know certain information about how and where you like to shop.  This document serves to explain our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of the information that we collect and receive from users of our Services.  Please know we have the utmost respect for your personal privacy and are committed to only use the data collected from ShopSuey users for your immediate or long-term benefit by improving the overall ShopSuey experience or providing sustainability for the Company.  Unless otherwise defined herein, terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms of Service.  This Privacy Policy applies to information that is provided or collected through all the Services provided by Shopping Made Mobile Inc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>What Information Do We Collect?</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5>Non-Personally Identifiable Information</h5>
<p>Our Platform may automatically record information your mobile phone/device sends or transmits, including your device type, your device ID number (e.g., your UDID), your user settings, your geographical location (for example, where you are in the mall, what stores are close-by) and information about your use of the Services such as which Content you viewed, e.g., offers and events, actions you took in response to Messages you received.  This information may also include which App screens you interacted with, search terms you used, date/time information and any other non-personally identifying information provided by you, e.g., your gender or date of birth.  It may also include information about the use of our website, social media accounts, the Platform, and anything you authorize us to receive from other content delivery platforms (e.g., Facebook) or provided by Affiliated Partners.  Collectively, this is all referred to as “Non-Personally Identifiable Information”)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5>Personal Information You Provide To Us</h5>
<p>During your use of ShopSuey, we may ask from time to time that you provide us with certain personally identifiable information, too, e.g., your name, email, home address, or phone number, which could be used to contact or identify you (“Personal Information”).  Personal Information may also include other information you supply to us concerning your preferences and interests expressed in the course of using the App or Services.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5>Information About You We May Obtain Through Other Sources</h5>
<p>We may also receive Personal Information from Affiliated Partners you have authorized to send us data, e.g., Facebook, or from third parties (e.g., white pages listings providers), subject to the limitations of the Privacy Policies of those Affiliated Partners or third parties.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5>Information About Transactions Through Partners</h5>
<p>To provide you with potential rewards and/or special offers, we may coordinate with third parties that may include the malls or stores you shop at, banks or credit or debit card networks or issues, or payment processors (“Partners”) to receive information about your transactions including but not limited to each transaction’s name, location, the date, time and amount of the transaction, a list or category summary of the purchased items or other personal information about you or the transaction (“Transactions”).  Unless the Partner’s privacy policy you accepted already allows for this information sharing, we will not use such information in this way without your permission by your explicit opt-in.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>When Do We Collect Information</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5>While You Shop</h5>
<p>ShopSuey is intended to function as your personal, ultimate shopping tool.  To do that, we collect information while you’re shopping about where you shop, what types of offers and events you respond to, your favorite stores, brands and other behaviors and preferences.  ShopSuey will track these things whenever you are physically nearby with your device and the App one of the locations in our database, e.g., a mall or merchant (“Locations”).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5>While You’re Away</h5>
<p>Whenever you’re not close to one of our Locations, ShopSuey won’t send you Messages or track your general behavior.  Our primary concern when you’re away is knowing when you’re physically nearby one of our Locations again.  Thus, to know this, ShopSuey must still, at the bare minimum, collect general information about your location, comparatively to the Locations in our database.  This does require your phone’s built-in GPS to be enabled and your phone turned on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5>As Requested</h5>
<p>Once your Account has been established, ShopSuey may occasionally request certain Personal Information during your use of the App or Services to fine-tune your experience, e.g., your name, gender or age; these questions may come in the form of a single, specific question, a survey or poll, or other formats, whether nearby or away from our Locations.  The requests are always optional and at your discretion whether or not to answer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>How Do We Use the Information?</h4>
<p>The terms “using” and “processing” information, as used in this policy, include using cookies or other storage means on a computer or mobile device, performing statistical analysis or collecting, storing, evaluating, modifying, deleting, using, combining, disclosing and transferring information within our organization or among our subsidiaries within the United States or internationally.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5>Non-Personally Identifiable Information</h5>
<p>We may use Non-Personally Identifiable Information to analyze trends through aggregated demographic, psychographic or behavioral information about our users generally, and thus, for example, to improve features and functionality of the Services and to make more relevant offers to users.  We may also share this Non-Personally Identifiable Information with our Partners to allow them to assist us in delivering tailored Messages, promotions, discounts, advertisements, and other benefits to you when you use the Services.  Any information shared with our Partners in this context will not contain nor be linked to your Personal Information unless you have “opted in” to allow it and your information matches the criteria the Partner has specified.  For example, a Partner may only want to offer a discount on its products to a certain audience (for example, men ages 25-45) or audience segment (for example, women ages 18-30 who have viewed certain content).  If the Non-Personally Identifiable Information that we have collected about you meets this description, you would be able to view and use the Content offered by that Partner.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5>Personal Information</h5>
<p>We use Personal Information only for the following purposes: (i) to personalize the behavior of your App or experience of the Services, (ii) to provide, improve and optimize the Platform, (iii) to provide you with App or Service updates or product announcements, (iv) to validate or authenticate you into your account or another service, (v) to better understand users’ needs and interests, and (vi) to occasionally provide you with further information and offers from us that we believe you may find useful or interesting, e.g., targeted advertising and promotional campaigns.  We may match some of your Personal Information with your Transactions to verify or authorize certain payments or transactions.  To protect your privacy, ShopSuey and our Partners exchange this information in a protected environment that does not allow our Partners to gain access to more Personal Information than is necessary for authorization.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5>Use of Cookies</h5>
<p>We may use “cookies” (a cookie is a small data file that is kept in your device’s memory for record-keeping purposes), and/or other storage on your device to help us collect, maintain, and use this information for two purposes: (1) to make the interactions easier and more personalized for you, we may utilize persistent cookies to save information relating to your Account and/or activity for future interactions with the Services, and (2) to better understand how you interact with ShopSuey and to monitor aggregate usage by ShopSuey users and web traffic routing across our Services.  Certain Partners may also place or read cookies on your browser from time to time.  Although not recommended (to maintain your App’s performance), you can instruct your browser at any time, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit.  Please understand that if you do not accept cookies, you may not be able to use all portions or all functionality of the Services.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5>Usage Patterns</h5>
<p>We may also use data collection tags or directives such as “pixel tags,” Javascript scripts, API calls, or similar means (individually or collectively, “Usage Tracking”) in combination with cookies and the demographic, behavioral and other data we have collected, and with third-party analysis partners, to analyze usage patterns of users anonymously and to serve Messages and/or advertisements to you that are tailored based on our analysis of what we believe you would respond favorably to in light of the information that we have collected or accessed about you as described above.  A “pixel tag” is an electronic image, often a single pixel and often transparent, that is placed on a web page and may be associated with cookies on your hard drive.  Usage Tracking allows us to count users who have visited certain web sites and pages within web sites, or used applications or features, to analyze the behavior of users of our web sites and application, in order to improve the web sites and application, and to personalize and determine the effectiveness of promotional or advertising campaigns.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>When Do We Share Information?</h4>
<p>We will not share your Personal Information with anyone (other than as described above) except to provide the Services and facilitate usage of the App when we have your permission, and also under the following circumstances:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5>Personal Information</h5>
<p>To take advantage of offers, events, discounts or other benefits being provided by Partners through the Platform, you must provide Partners with identifying information (which may include Personal Information) at or before the point of sale, to enable the Partner to verify that you have a ShopSuey Account and are authorized for the transaction, or to redeem the benefit.  In this context, the Personal Information you provide to the Partner will only be used by the Partner to record the transaction you make at the time you are redeeming an offer, and the Partner will then share the transaction information with us.  Personal Information may also be used when connecting you with friends, accepting or creating meeting or parking spots, and sharing the Content you find within the App or through the Services with others, either through social media, email or any other means.  Personal Information used any of these contexts will be bound by this Privacy Policy.  If you do not wish to share Personal Information, please change your Account settings within the App to remove such Personal Information, or do not take advantage of Partner offers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5>Non-Personally Identifiable Information</h5>
<p>We may share this type of anonymized information with our Partners, the Locations in our database, e.g., mall and stores, certain state and/or tourism authorities, marketing firms, other third parties or the general public (e.g., through white papers or press articles) aggregated information in a form that does not disclose your Personal Information, nor be reasonably likely to allow you to be personally identified, for industry analysis, consumer confidence indications, demographic profiling or other statistical analysis.  We share this aggregated information so these entities understand the level of interest our users have in their products and services, so these entities may assist ShopSuey in providing you with an optimal shopping experience, and so additional retail or brand partners can see the opportunity in ShopSuey and may become our Partners and further enrich what ShopSuey offers its users. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5>Service Providers or Agents</h5>
<p>We may employ or partner with third party companies and individuals to process your payments, Transactions, facilitate our Services, to provide all or a portion of our Services on our behalf, to perform Services-related services (e.g., without limitation, maintenance services, database management, web analytics, download provisioning and improvement of the App or Services&#8217; features) or to assist us in analyzing how our Platform is used. These third parties may have access to your Personal Information or Non-Personally Identifiable Information, but only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are bound by working agreements of their own and obligated not to disclose or use it for other purposes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5>Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement</h5>
<p>When required by law, we may disclose information about you to government and law enforcement officials and private parties, including IP addresses information, for the purposes of fraud prevention, to protect the property and rights of ShopSuey or a third party, to protect the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop activity we may consider to be, or to pose a risk of being, any illegal, unethical or legally actionable activity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5>Business Transfers</h5>
<p>We reserve the right to transfer or otherwise share your Personal Information in connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization, sale, or bankruptcy of our Company, our licensors, or our assets, or in the event of our bankruptcy but only under similar Privacy Policy conditions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>How Can I Change or Delete My Personal Information?</h4>
<p>You may review, update, correct or delete your Personal Information in your registration profile by contacting us or by making the appropriate modifications in your Account preferences.  Please note that if you completely delete all such information, your account may eventually become deactivated.  If you would like us to delete your Account and/or remove your records from our system, please contact us through the website and we will be happy to help, so long as we do not have any legal obligation to retain the record.<br />
?
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Children’s Information</h4>
<p>Our Services are not directed to children (below the age of 13) and we do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children.  If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with Personal Information without their consent, please contact us.  If we become aware that a member is under the age of 13 and has provided us with false Personal Information or has done so without verifiable parental consent, we will delete such information from our files.<br />
?
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Is My Information Secure?</h4>
<p>We employ administrative and electronic measures designed to safeguard and protect your information from unauthorized access and disclosure.  Additionally, we will delete information after it is no longer useful for providing the Services.  We will make any legally required disclosures of any breach of the security, confidentiality, or integrity of your unencrypted electronically stored “personal data” (as defined in applicable state statutes on security breach notification) known to you via email or conspicuous posting on the Services in the most expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay, insofar as consistent with the legitimate needs of law enforcement or any measures necessary to determine the scope of the breach and restore the reasonable integrity of the data system.<br />
?
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>International Transfer</h4>
<p>Your information may be transferred to, and/or maintained on, computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction.  Our Privacy Policy and its protection for you still applies under this situation.  If you are located outside the United States and choose to provide information to us, ShopSuey may transfer your Personal Information to the United States and processes it there.  Your submission of such information represents your agreement to that transfer.<br />
?
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Links to Other Sites</h4>
<p>Our Services may contain links or API’s (e.g., data or content exchange interfaces), to external services or websites of other partners or advertisers, including our Partners, for information or functionality or services.  If you choose to visit a partner or advertiser by “clicking on” or selecting a button, service, banner ad, or other type of advertisement, or other third party link, you will be directed to that third party’s resources.  The fact that we may link to or incorporate a partner&#8217;s services, functionality, or website, or present a banner ad or other type of advertisement, is not an endorsement, authorization or representation of our affiliation with that third party, nor is it an endorsement of their privacy or information security policies or practices.  We do not exercise control over third party services, functionality, websites or other resources, including their use of personal information, and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose any personal information to a third party.  We encourage you to read the privacy policies or statements of the other websites you visit to learn more about their privacy practices.  These other parties may place their own cookies or other files on your computer or device, collect data or solicit personal information from you.  Other services follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the personal information you submit to them.  Our Privacy Policy only applies to our App and Services, and we are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of other websites.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Agreement and Changes to this Privacy Policy</h4>
<p>By using any part of the App or Services, you agree to the current Privacy Policy and Terms of Service, to which this Privacy Policy is incorporated.  We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to modify, discontinue, or terminate any or all of the Services or to modify this Privacy Policy at any time without advanced notice.  Any modifications will be effective immediately as of the date the modified Privacy Policy is posted on our website.  By continuing to access or use the Services after we have posted a modification, you are indicating that you agree to be bound by the modified Privacy Policy.<br />
?
