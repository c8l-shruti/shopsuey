												<h1>ShopSuey Terms of Service</h1>
												<p>By using ShopSuey, you are agreeing to the following terms and conditions (“Terms”) and the associated Privacy Policy discussed below.  Please read everything carefully.  Collectively, these terms govern your use of and access to the ShopSuey mobile application (“App”) and any related services made available by its parent company, Shopping Made Mobile Inc. (“we”, “us”, “the Company”), on any media platform (“Services”).  Together, the App and Services constitute the ShopSuey Platform (“ShopSuey”, “Platform”) and by downloading the App, accessing or using any portion of the Platform, you agree to comply with these Terms.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>License</h4>
<p>Subject to your compliance with the Terms, you may download and install one (1) copy of the App to each of your supported devices and access and use the Services solely for your own personal and non-commercial use.  You may not: (i) copy, modify or distribute the App or the Services for any purpose; (ii) transfer, sublicense, lease, lend, rent or otherwise distribute the App or the Services to anyone else; (iii) reverse-engineer, decompile or create derivative works of the App or Services; (iv) make the functionality of the App or the Services available to multiple users through any means; (v) use multiple accounts per individual user and/or per device; or (vi) use the Services in any unlawful manner, for any unlawful purpose, or in any manner inconsistent with the Terms.  No other licenses or rights are granted to you by implication or otherwise under any intellectual property rights owned or controlled by the Company, its licensors, or third parties.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Messaging</h4>
<p>As part of the Services, you may receive push notifications, local client notifications, alerts, emails or other types of messages directly sent to you inside or outside the App (“Messages”).  Please remember you have control over the Message settings (FAQ Section) and can opt in or out at any time through the App or through the phone’s operating system, with the possible exception of infrequent but important service announcements and administrative messages, which will not include advertisements.  Please be aware that, messaging fees may apply depending on your wireless plan.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Registration</h4>
<p>To access certain features of the App and Services, you must create a profile with ShopSuey (an “Account”).  To create an Account or participate with our App or Services, you must be at least 13 years of age or older at the time of registration.  If you are younger than 18 years of age, you must ensure your parents consent to your using the Services.  Please note that some of the Platform’s Content and Messages may contain advertisements or offers related to alcohol, tobacco or other items that require a minimum age.  Thus, if you are younger than 18 years of age, you must also submit your birthday to the Company; otherwise, we may have no way of determining your age and will not be held liable for any Content or Messages you receive through the Platform or any actions resulting from their use.  You agree that the information you provide us will be true, accurate, current and complete.  The security of your information and our Platform is very important.  You agree not to disclose your password or login credentials to anyone else and that you will be solely responsible for any and all activities or actions taken under your Account; should any unauthorized access to your Account occur, you must notify us immediately.  We will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with the Terms.  By creating an Account, you consent to the use of electronic means, e.g. a website, to convey the Terms and any notices or updates to the Terms in the future, and the use of electronic records to store information related to your Account, Content and the Terms or your use of the Platform.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Privacy</h4>
<p>Our goal is to make the Platform as enjoyable and rewarding for you as possible.  To do that, we need to collect and process information from you when you use the Platform.  This includes your usage of the Platform while you’re shopping, where you are, and how you interact with Messages and other Content (defined below) you receive while you’re there.  From time to time, we may also collect certain personally identifiable information from you as set forth in more detail in our Privacy Policy, which is part of the Terms.  By accessing the Platform, you agree that we may collect, use and disclose, certain information you provide during your access to or use of the Platform, and in some cases information that is provided to the Platform by other parties, e.g. Facebook.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Payment</h4>
<p>ShopSuey is presently being offered for free.  While we have no plans at this time to change this, we reserve the right to begin charging a fee for using parts of ShopSuey at any time in the future, or for new downloads or new accounts.  In the event that your continued access to the App or Services requires a new fee, you will receive notice and at least 30 days to accept the new price or opt out, should you so wish.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Content</h4>
<p>ShopSuey is a community supported by its users.  The App and Services rely on users for certain text, graphics, audio, images, other content and information, for display or publication through the App or Services (“Content”).  It’s important we’re able to freely use that Content to properly store and distribute the Content across the Platform.  Submitting Content through the App or Services grants the Company a worldwide, royalty-free, and transferable license to use, reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works of, display, and perform the Content in connection with the Platform and the Company’s business, including without limitation for promoting and redistributing part or all of the Platform (and derivative works thereof) in any media formats and through any media channels.  Depending on your settings, Content you submit through the Services may be viewed by and shared with other users, e.g. on social networks like Twitter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Much of the Content in ShopSuey is user-generated.  We, and our licensors, cannot endorse any Content or any opinion, recommendation, warranty, information or advice expressed therein, and we expressly disclaim any and all liability in connection with any Content.  Additionally, we reserve the right to decide whether particular Content is appropriate and complies with the Terms, and may remove Content at any time, at our sole discretion.  The company will fully cooperate with any law enforcement authorities or court order requiring the release of any Content or user information we have available.</p>

<h4>Disclaimers</h4>

<h4>General</h4>
<p>The Terms are the entire agreement between you and the Company, concerning the Platform, and supersede all prior or contemporaneous communications between you and the Company, the website or the Company with respect to any part of the Platform.  If any provision of the Terms is deemed invalid, the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect.  No waiver of any term of the Terms shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and our failure to assert any right or provision under the Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.  The Terms shall be governed by Hawaii law, and any dispute arising from or relating to this Agreement will be finally settled by arbitration in Honolulu, Hawaii.  The prevailing party in any arbitration or other proceeding arising under the Terms will be entitled to receive reimbursement of its reasonable expenses and attorneys’ fees.  We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to modify, discontinue or terminate any or all of the Platform at any time, or modify the Terms, with or without notice.  All modified terms and conditions will be immediately effective as of the date the modified Terms are posted on the “ShopSuey Website” and will apply to all Accounts and Members enrolled in the Platform.  Use of the Platform is always optional, and by continuing to access or use the App and/or the Services after we have posted the new terms and conditions on the site, you agree to be bound by such changes.  If you have any questions about the Terms, please contact us at tos@getshopsueyapp.com.</p>
